## Hi, We are CERIA Team! 👋

Background Project

In sports, it is important to know the normal heart rate so that a person can understand when to decrease or increase the intensity of movements. The problem is that during exercise, it is very unlikely for someone to be able to be aware of their heart rate every second, making it difficult to adjust the heart rate to normal counts. We find that listening to music with low or high tempo influences the speed of the heart rate. When the heart beats too fast, someone prefers to listen to music with a low tempo to become calmer, and vice versa. During exercise, people who are listening to music often pause their exercise for a moment to change the song they want to listen to. Our team tried to combine these two aspects to investigate the issues and possible solutions. We aim to create a system that allows users to listen to music while exercising that can balance the calmness without having to stop every time just to choose those songs. We found a gap where the tempo of the songs recommended by the system will be based on the user's heart rate and preference  for more in line with what the user often listens to.
